# DuinoCoin-DinoMiner
This is basically a custom [DuinoCoin](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin) Miner I made using python. The goal itself is to simplify the miner code base while having (I think :/) the same performance with Official PC-Miner.


## Duino Coin
á•² Duino-Coin is a coin that can be mined with almost everything, including Arduino boards.

## Requirements
Make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed and also have pip install everything in `requirements.txt`. I personally use [Python 3.7.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/), but any other version should work just fine.
